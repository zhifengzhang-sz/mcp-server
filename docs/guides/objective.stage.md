# Objective Stage Definition

> **Purpose**: Transform architecture documents into clear project objectives  
> **Input**: docs/architecture/*.md files (strategic-roadmap.md, mcp-integration-strategy.md, etc.)  
> **Output**: docs/objective/phase.N.md files with clear contracts  
> **Pattern Source**: Extracted from docs/objective/phase.1.md

## Input-Output Mapping

**Required Input Files:**
- `docs/architecture/strategic-roadmap.md` - Phase definitions and strategic direction
- `docs/architecture/mcp-integration-strategy.md` - Technical integration approach  
- `docs/architecture/sagent-architecture.md` - Multi-agent system design
- `docs/architecture/development-environment.md` - Development constraints

**Output Generation Rule:**
```
docs/architecture/strategic-roadmap.md[Phase N] 
+ docs/architecture/mcp-integration-strategy.md[Phase N] 
→ docs/objective/phase.N.md
```

## Step-by-Step Transformation Process

### Step 1: Extract Phase Content from Architecture
1. **Open** `docs/architecture/strategic-roadmap.md`
2. **Find** section matching "Phase N" (e.g., "Phase 1: Foundation")
3. **Extract** deliverables, timeline, and strategic goals
4. **Open** `docs/architecture/mcp-integration-strategy.md` 
5. **Find** corresponding Phase N section
6. **Extract** technical approach, integration points, and constraints

### Step 2: Map Architecture → Objective Concepts
```
Architecture Concept → Objective Element
─────────────────────────────────────────
Strategic Goal → Strategic Value
Deliverable List → Core Objectives  
Technical Approach → Architecture Pattern
Integration Points → Extension Points
Constraints → Design Principles
Dependencies → Architecture Context
```

### Step 3: Transform Language Style
```
Architecture Language → Objective Language
─────────────────────────────────────────
"Implement X using Y" → "X with Y Pattern"
"Phase N delivers..." → "Objective N: Component with Pattern"
"Enables future..." → "Extension Points" + "Phase Extension Strategy"
"Uses technology Z" → "Z Interface Contract" + mathematical spec
```

### Step 4: Generate Mathematical Specifications
For each technical component mentioned in architecture:
1. **Create type definitions** for data structures
2. **Define interface contracts** with function signatures  
3. **Specify composition patterns** using mathematical notation
4. **Add extension interfaces** for future phases

## Objective Document Structure

### Required Header Pattern
```markdown
# [Phase Name]: [Core Purpose]

> **[Design Philosophy Summary]**  
> **Architecture Alignment**: [Reference to architecture docs]  
> **Design Philosophy**: [Core patterns - functional, plugin, etc.]  
> **Goal**: [Extensibility statement]
```

### Architecture Context Section
**MUST include**:
- References to specific architecture documents
- Phase positioning within overall strategy  
- Forward-looking extension points for future phases
- Core design principles (functional programming, plugin architecture, etc.)

### Strategic Value Section
**MUST include**:
- **Problem Solved**: Clear statement of architectural challenge
- **Solution**: High-level approach with benefits
- **Future Phase Enablement**: How this phase enables subsequent phases

### Core Objectives Structure
Each objective MUST follow this pattern:

```markdown
### Objective N: [Component Name] with [Pattern Type]
**Purpose**: [Clear statement with extension points]

**[Pattern Name] Pattern**:
```
[Mathematical/architectural specification]
Type System:
  [Type definitions]
  
Interface Contract:
  [Contract specifications]
  
Operations:
  [Operation definitions]
```

**Extension Points**:
```
Interface: [ExtensionInterface]
  Purpose: [How future phases extend this]
  Contract: [Function signatures]
```

**Phase Extension Strategy**:
```
Phase N Core (Immutable):
  [Core implementations that don't change]

Phase N+1 Adapter Pattern (Pure Add-On):
  [How next phase extends without modification]

Functional Composition (Core Unchanged):
  [Composition patterns preserving immutability]
```
```

## Content Generation Rules

### 1. Architecture Traceability
- **MUST reference** specific architecture documents
- **MUST align** with strategic roadmap phases
- **MUST show** integration strategy implementation

### 2. Extension Point Design
- **Every objective MUST** define extension interfaces
- **Every pattern MUST** be extensible without core modification
- **Every component MUST** support plugin architecture

### 3. Functional Programming Emphasis
- **MUST use** immutable data structures
- **MUST define** pure function interfaces
- **MUST show** composition patterns
- **MUST include** mathematical specifications

### 4. Forward Compatibility
- **MUST explain** how future phases extend current phase
- **MUST avoid** architectural lock-in
- **MUST design** for plugin addition without core changes

## Mathematical Specification Patterns

### Interface Contracts
```
Interface: ComponentName
  operation: InputType → OutputType
  property: () → PropertyType
```

### Composition Patterns  
```
Pipeline = Component₁ → Component₂ → ... → Componentₙ
Enhancement = fold(apply_enhancement, base_component, enhancement_list)
```

### Extension Patterns
```
BaseComponent + [Extension₁, Extension₂, ...] = EnhancedComponent
ExtensionInterface = ComponentState → ComponentState
```

## Example Objective Structure

Based on successful pattern from phase.1.md:

1. **Plugin-Ready Foundation** - Core infrastructure with extension points
2. **Functional Registry Pattern** - Immutable core with adapter chain
3. **Provider Architecture** - Interface-based provider system
4. **Event Sourcing Pattern** - Immutable event-driven state management

Each following the full pattern with:
- Mathematical specifications
- Extension interfaces  
- Phase progression strategy
- Immutable core + adapter extensions
