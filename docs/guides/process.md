# Development Process

1. **Architecture** → **Objectives**
   - Take architectural vision
   - Break into concrete, measurable objectives
   - Define success criteria
   - Specify extension points

2. **Objectives** → **Design**
   - Map objectives to C4 model components
   - Define interfaces and data flows
   - Specify patterns and relationships
   - Ensure design covers all objectives

3. **Design** → **Implementation**
   - Transform design into language-specific specs
   - Define concrete types and interfaces
   - Specify error handling and testing
   - Document integration points

Each transformation preserves:
- Extension points for future phases
- Clear contracts between components
- Traceability to previous stage
