## Phase 1 Scope

**Focus**: Local LLM infrastructure with MCP integration for IDE Agent Applications (VS Code Copilot Chat & Cursor AI Chat)

**Architecture Context**: This phase implements the core components described in:
- [MCP Integration Strategy](../architecture/mcp-integration-strategy.md) - Section 2.1: Local MCP Server Foundation
- [sAgent Architecture](../architecture/sagent-architecture.md) - Section 1: Local LLM Infrastructure
- [Development Environment](../architecture/development-environment.md) - Section 3: Python Server Setup

## Fundamental Objectives

**Primary Goal**: Transform a basic local LLM into a context-aware, tool-enabled development assistant that maintains conversation continuity and exhibits agent-like behaviors without explicit agent architecture.

**Secondary Goal**: Achieve sophisticated AI assistance through MCP tool integration across multiple IDE environments (VS Code, Cursor) and local CLI applications, enabling rich developer interactions while maintaining architectural simplicity.

## Core Objectives

### Objective 1: Context-Enhanced Local LLM Application

**Purpose**: Build a local LLM application with robust context continuation through MCP-provided capabilities that maintain conversation coherence and user context across interactions.

**Behavior**:
- **Synchronous Response Generation**: Real-time LLM inference with context assembly
- **Persistent Context Management**: Cross-session conversation and workspace state retention
- **Tool-Enhanced Context**: Dynamic context enrichment through MCP tool integration
- **Memory-Aware Processing**: Historical interaction patterns inform current responses
**Required Capabilities**:

**Context Continuation Operations**:
- `assembleContext(userQuery, sessionHistory, workspaceState)` - Gather relevant context from multiple sources for LLM processing
- `persistConversation(interaction, metadata, toolUsage)` - Store interaction data for future context retrieval
- `retrieveRelevantHistory(currentQuery, sessionId, maxTokens)` - Fetch pertinent past interactions within token limits
- `manageContextWindow(assembledContext, modelLimits)` - Optimize context to fit within model constraints while preserving relevance
- `crossSessionContinuity(userId, newSessionQuery)` - Maintain user context across different conversation sessions

**Tool Integration Operations**:
- `registerMCPTools(toolDefinitions)` - Register available tools with the MCP server for LLM access
- `executeToolCall(toolName, parameters, contextMetadata)` - Execute tools requested by LLM with proper error handling
- `integrateToolResults(toolOutput, conversationContext)` - Incorporate tool results back into conversation flow
- `trackToolUsage(toolName, parameters, results, timestamp)` - Maintain history of tool usage for pattern recognition
- `coordinateToolChain(toolSequence, sharedContext)` - Enable tools to share context and build upon each other's results

**Model Management Operations**:
- `loadModel(modelIdentifier, hardwareConstraints)` - Initialize local LLM with hardware-appropriate configuration
- `switchModel(newModelId, preserveContext)` - Change active model while maintaining conversation continuity
- `monitorModelPerformance(metrics, thresholds)` - Track model performance and resource usage
- `optimizeInference(contextSize, responseRequirements)` - Adjust inference parameters for optimal performance
- `manageModelResources(memoryLimits, concurrentRequests)` - Handle resource allocation for model operations

**Input/Output Contracts**:
- **assembleContext**: Takes user query (string), session history (array), workspace state (object), returns assembled context (object)
- **persistConversation**: Takes interaction data (object), metadata (object), tool usage (array), returns success confirmation (boolean)
- **retrieveRelevantHistory**: Takes current query (string), session ID (string), token limits (number), returns relevant history (array)
- **manageContextWindow**: Takes assembled context (object), model limits (object), returns optimized context (object)
- **crossSessionContinuity**: Takes user ID (string), new query (string), returns continuation context (object)

**Error Conditions**:
- **CONTEXT_ASSEMBLY_FAILED**: Unable to gather required context from available sources
- **PERSISTENCE_ERROR**: Context storage operation failed due to storage system issues
- **RETRIEVAL_TIMEOUT**: Context retrieval exceeded maximum allowed time
- **CONTEXT_OVERFLOW**: Assembled context exceeds model token limits and cannot be optimized
- **TOOL_EXECUTION_FAILED**: MCP tool call failed during context enhancement
- **MODEL_UNAVAILABLE**: Requested LLM model cannot be loaded or accessed
- **MEMORY_EXHAUSTED**: Insufficient system resources for context management operations
- **SESSION_CORRUPTION**: Session data is corrupted and cannot be used for context continuation

**Side Effects**:
- **File System Access**: Reads workspace files for context assembly
- **Database Operations**: Stores and retrieves conversation history and user preferences
- **Model I/O**: Loads and executes local language models
- **Memory Usage**: Maintains context caches and conversation state in memory

**Performance Guarantees**:
- **Context Assembly**: < 500ms for typical workspace contexts
- **Context Retrieval**: < 200ms for session history lookup
- **Model Loading**: < 30 seconds for models up to 70B parameters
- **Tool Integration**: < 100ms overhead per tool call
- **Memory Usage**: < 2GB RAM for basic context management operations

### Objective 2: IDE Agent Applications Through Tool Ecosystem

**Purpose**: Enable agent-like behavior across multiple IDE environments without explicitly building agent architecture—leveraging MCP's tool ecosystem to give IDE-integrated LLMs expanded capabilities that simulate sophisticated agent functionality.

**Architecture Reference**: Implements the "IDE Integration" and "Tool Ecosystem" components from [MCP Integration Strategy](../architecture/mcp-integration-strategy.md) Section 3.2.

- Cross-tool context sharing and correlation enables IDE LLMs to use insights from one tool to inform usage of other tools
- Tool execution history and pattern recognition allows systems to learn user preferences and suggest increasingly relevant tool usage
- Workspace-aware tool behavior ensures tool operations are contextually appropriate for current project and development environment

## System Architecture and Data Flow

### System Overview
The Phase 1 system is fundamentally a local LLM application with enhanced context continuation capabilities, delivered through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). All system features—document processing, knowledge management, file operations, and external integrations—serve the primary purpose of providing rich, persistent context to the LLM for improved conversation continuity.

**Objective 1**: Build a local LLM application with robust context continuation through MCP-provided capabilities. These capabilities include:
- **Document Access Tools**: Retrieve and analyze files, codebases, and documentation to provide relevant context for current conversations
- **Knowledge Base Integration**: Search through embeddings and knowledge graphs to find related information from past interactions and stored knowledge
- **Session Memory Management**: Persist conversation history, user preferences, and interaction patterns across sessions
- **Workspace Awareness Tools**: Understand project structure, file relationships, and development context to provide contextually appropriate responses
- **External Data Integration**: Access APIs, databases, and external services to enrich responses with current and relevant information

**How These Aid Context Continuation**: Each capability feeds contextual information back into the LLM's processing, enabling responses that build upon previous conversations, understand the user's specific environment, and maintain coherent long-term interactions rather than treating each request in isolation.

**Objective 2**: Enable agent-like behavior across multiple IDE environments without explicitly building agent architecture—leveraging MCP's tool ecosystem to give IDE-integrated LLMs expanded capabilities. These capabilities include:
- **Development Tool Integration**: Access to file operations, code analysis, debugging tools, and testing frameworks through MCP tools
- **Workflow Automation Tools**: Execute multi-step development tasks by chaining tool calls within IDE LLM responses
- **Real-time Information Access**: Web search, API calls, and live data retrieval to supplement IDE LLM knowledge with current information
- **Cross-Tool Coordination**: Use results from one tool to inform the parameters and usage of other tools within the same interaction
- **Environment Manipulation**: Modify files, run commands, manage git operations, and interact with the development environment

**How These Simulate Agent Behavior**: Rather than building explicit planning and execution loops, IDE LLMs (Copilot, Cursor) use MCP tools reactively within their response generation, creating sophisticated behaviors that appear agent-like but are actually enhanced context continuation with tool access.

**MCP's Role**: MCP serves as the universal interface that allows the LLM to access tools, data, and external systems for context enhancement. Rather than building complex agent orchestration, we use MCP to provide the LLM with a rich toolkit that enables sophisticated responses through context continuation rather than multi-step planning. Specifically:
- **Tool Discovery and Registration**: MCP allows the LLM to discover available tools and understand their capabilities for context gathering
- **Standardized Tool Interface**: Consistent tool calling mechanism allows the LLM to access diverse capabilities (file system, databases, APIs, external services) through a unified protocol
- **Context Injection Pipeline**: Tool results are automatically integrated back into the LLM's context window for immediate use in response generation
- **Session State Management**: MCP handles the persistence of tool usage history and results, contributing to long-term context continuity
- **Real-time Capability Expansion**: New tools can be added to the MCP server without modifying the LLM, expanding context capabilities dynamically

**Dependency Chain Analysis**:
1. **Hardware → Model Selection**: GPU availability determines which models can run effectively
2. **Model Capabilities → Feature Availability**: Model size/quality limits system intelligence
3. **Storage Performance → Response Time**: Fast storage enables real-time context retrieval
4. **Memory Management → Concurrent Users**: Efficient memory use determines scalability
5. **Network Integration → External Capabilities**: API access expands system capabilities beyond local resources

**Failure Mode Considerations**:
- **LLM Failure**: System degrades to basic tool execution without intelligent reasoning
- **Storage Failure**: System loses conversation continuity but maintains basic functionality
- **MCP Failure**: System becomes inaccessible from VS Code but core engine remains functional
- **Tool Failure**: Specific capabilities become unavailable but core conversation continues
