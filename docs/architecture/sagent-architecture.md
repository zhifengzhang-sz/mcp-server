# Specialized Agent (sAgent) Architecture

## Definition

Specialized Agents (sAgents) represent the core architectural pattern combining Prompt Engineering (PE) with Small Language Models (sLLMs) to create efficient, task-specific AI agents.

## Design Philosophy

### sAgent = PE + sLLM

**Prompt Engineering (PE)**: Human expertise encoding that provides:
- Task specification and constraints
- Domain knowledge integration
- Quality control parameters
- Output formatting requirements

**Small Language Models (sLLMs)**: Efficient inference engines that provide:
- Specialized capabilities through finetuning
- Function calling for tool integration
- Optimized compute/performance balance
- Rapid response times
