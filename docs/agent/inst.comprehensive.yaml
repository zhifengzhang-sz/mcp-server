# ============================================================================
# CORE VERIFICATION OBJECTIVE
# ============================================================================

objective: |
  Verify complete end-to-end consistency across all documentation layers to ensure:
  
  1. **Complete Traceability**: Every objective requirement traces through all layers to implementation
  2. **Bi-directional Consistency**: Forward and backward traceability maintained
  3. **Pattern Coherence**: Consistent patterns and principles across all layers
  4. **Interface Integrity**: Interface consistency maintained through all layers
  5. **Extension Continuity**: Extension points preserved and enhanced through all layers
  6. **Phase Alignment**: All layers support the 4-phase roadmap consistently
