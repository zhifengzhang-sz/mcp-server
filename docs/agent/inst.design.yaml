objective: |
  Verify complete consistency between design specifications (docs/design/) 
  and implementation specifications (docs/impl/) to ensure:
  
  1. **Design Implementation**: Implementation docs implement all design specifications
  2. **Interface Fidelity**: Implementation interfaces match design interfaces exactly
  3. **Pattern Preservation**: Implementation maintains design patterns and principles
  4. **Extension Point Integrity**: Implementation preserves all design extension points
  5. **Production Readiness**: Implementation adds production concerns while maintaining design
